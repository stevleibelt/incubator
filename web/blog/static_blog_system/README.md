    * date format
    * external dependencies
        * path to the markdown binary (like /usr/bin/markdown)
        * path to the editor (like /usr/bin/vim)
 
## Workflow

* validate configuration
* test markdown ("line 1\n\nline 2" == "<p>line 1</p>\n\n<p>line 2</p>"
* update entries cataloge to get new or changed markdown files
* parse new or changed markdown files into html
    * add the comment section if needed
* update index page
* update archive pages
* update tage page
* update feed manatement if needed

## Commands

* edit entry <file name>
* create entry <file name>
* list entries
* delete entry <file name>
* delete all entries
* publish entry <file name>
* publish all entries

## Thoughts

* wrapp content, headline and tag parts of an entry with comments like "<!-- begin of content section -->/<!-- end of content seciont -->" to ease up cutting and updating
* do not complicate things, take a look to the smart way how cfenolloasa solves problem (like rss feed generation :-))
