# Static Page Generator

Tired of blog systems because they are for the web browser users?
Currently, i am. I do not want to blame the guys who are throwing there time on great open source projects to build a blog system with used by web browser. But thinking about myself, all i want is to write something in markdown or similar and upload this entry.

## Core Functions

* one template
* supports sections and subsections and subsections ...
* supports tags
* supports markdown
* a cron job/or manually triggered generation of parts possible (to fetch rss entries by other sites)
* a cron job/or manually triggered generation of articles
* cli generator
    * hook or event based for easy up extension 
    * generate file/entry/parts based content
    * generate all (reset of old content)
* rss and atom feed generation
* internal linking
* pure php array configuration

## Nice To Have

* rest api to simple
    * add an entry (generation done on the server)
    * add media
    * handle tags (list, add, remove, modify)
    * trigger cron jobs
* supports restructured text
* caching for converted markdown to html snippets
* meta data for each entry (default by section and tags)
* teaser for each entry
* search
* comments
* picture upload
* web generator

## Currently Not Wanted

    * easy up human readable url renaming
    * easy up internal and external linking

## Components

* rest web service to verifiy validity of id/passphrase combination (identity)
* cli component that implements general logic to communicate with upper rest service

## Configurable Values

* base url
* archive url
* section url
* tag url
* page title 
* default author
* entries per page per month

## Workflow

* write entry in my_file.md
    * contains
        * header
            * section
            * tag
            * [meta data]
            * [author]
        * body
            * use pre compile statement like ##TEASER_START## to special information
            * content
* validate via cli
* upload file
* trigger page generation (pages are collections of unique html dom ids, generate content of dom id and replace content of old id in files)
    * convert markdown to html snippet
    * generate content if dom element 
    * update tag page (if new exists, recalculate usage of tags)
    * update used tag pages (add link to entry, newest first)
    * update archive (current month section)
    * update main page

## Structure Of Content

* one main page of current month with link to previous[/next] month (link to archive)
* one section page of current month with link to previous[/next] month (link to archive)
* one tags page with link to each tag page, ordered by usage
* one tag page with links to each article, ordered by date

## Unordered Ideas

* syntax highlighting like in github
* cli command to create new entry (creates an file with unique id and put it into a date based directory structure like "2015/10/24/1818-<uuid>.md"
* "magic" headlines like "## tags" or "## category"
* static content refresh can be done via cronjob (once|x a day) or by triggering/calling an url (with authentication))
* static content is available by the following urls
    * /archive?page=2
    * /2015?page=2
    * /2015/10?page=2
    * /2015/10/24?page=2 (optional)
    * /<category>?page=2
    * /<tag>?page=2 (optional or done via dynamic page generation
* a git repository can be a valid storage engine (for fetching the upcomming/next files or entries)
