Static Page Generator
=====================

Tired of blog systems because they are for the web browser users?
Currently, i am. I don't want to blame the guys who are throwing there time on great open source projects to build a blog system with used by webbrowser. But thinking about myself, all i want is to write something in markdown or similar and upload this entry.
