# Babyphone

This are my free as in freedom but under GPL-V3 ideas about a modern babyphone. Why? Because the available are simple sucking.

# Design

* three devices
    * one device for the kids (microphone, speaker, temperature sensore and optional sleeping light)
    * one device for the parents (microphone, speaker, display and buttons for the settings)
        * only device with a battery (standard batteries, no proprietary battery pack)
        * battery can be switched on and off (which implies charging if connected to the power circut)
    * one device as radio station that is dealing as the access point between the devices above
# benefits of this thoughts
   * the radio station is somehow in the middle of both devices which results in longer range or less power usage (radiation)
   * the radio station is storing all the settings and language based content while the other two devices are only dealing with the open source data protocoll and reacting on things
