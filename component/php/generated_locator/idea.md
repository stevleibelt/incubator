# Locator Generator

Inspired by an [php usergroup meetup](http://artodeto.bazzline.net/archives/525-Social-Human-Architecture-for-Beginners-and-the-Flip-Side-of-Dependency-Injection-PHPUGHH.html), I started thinking about this configured locators around the web (especially with their generic "->get('foo')" interfaces.
Thats why I this project should lead to an locator, that can be configured as known but will be generated like propel is doing it with their classes. The benefit is the working code completion on your ide and you can see what the locator is doing instead of hoping it.
