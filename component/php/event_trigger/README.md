# Generic Event Trigger Component

This component will help you to implement a generic event trigger in your application.

It either ends up by using a runtime event dispatcher, a REST based event dispatcher or a BUS based event dispatcher.

# features

* uses a generic event class to increase interoperability
* generic event transporter (bus, rest, runtime)
* priority support
* event propagation can be stopped
* promises
* event emitter
* event dispatcher
* event loop
* co-routines
* logs events in an audit.log or event.log

# terms

* emitter - sends an event

# Unordered Thoughts

* instead of adding the option to stop the propagation, you should implement the logic for this in a new event which triggers your real event only under special circumstances or creates an event to reject the previous changes
* because of no support for stopping the propagation, we do not need priorities while dispatching
* an event emitter is populating the event
* an event processor is dispatching the event

With Event Sourcing we also capture each event. If we are using a persistent store the events will be persisted just the same as the ship objects are. I find it useful to say that we are persisting two different things an application state and an event log.

Event Sourcing also raises some possibilities for your overall architecture, particularly if you are looking for something that is very scalable. There is a fair amount of interest in 'event-driven architecture' these days. This term covers a fair range of ideas, but most of centers around systems communicating through event messages. Such systems can operate in a very loosely coupled parallel style which provides excellent horizontal scalability and resilience to systems failure.
