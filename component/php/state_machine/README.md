# StateMachine Component for PHP

## Basic concept and terms

A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine](Finite State Machine) abstracts the switching from one state to another. Furthermore, a state machine can only be in one state.
It can change a state by a triggered event or a condition.

A state is a status that is waiting to execute a transition. A switch from one state to another is called a transition.

A transition is a collection of actions executed if an event is triggered or a condition is fulfilled.
