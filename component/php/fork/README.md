# Fork Component for PHP

## Terms

* Manager
    * gets tasks attached
    * uses sub processes to execute task
    * takes care that forking is available
    * implements posix signal handling
    * taking care of optional runtime limit
    * taking care of optional memory limit
    * taking care of maximal number of sub processes

* Thread
    * the stupid simple sub process that works on a well defined task
    * implements posix signal handling

* AbstractTask
    * implements the unique logic a sub process should execute

## Additional Ideas

* an event listener can be used to easy up extending this component
* add shared memory for inter process calls (ipc)
* add logging (by event event handler?)
* a sub process should implement
    * getProcessId()
    * getParentProcessId()
    * getRuntime()
    * getMemoryUsage()
    * setGroupId($groupId)
    * setUserId($userId)
