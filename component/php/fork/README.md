# Fork Component for PHP

## Terms

* ForkManager
    * gets tasks attached
    * uses sub processes to execute task
    * takes care that forking is available
    * implements posix signal handling
    * taking care of optional runtime limit
    * taking care of optional memory limit
    * taking care of maximal number of sub processes
    * provides method "setUpPOSIXSignalHandling" and "dispatchPOSIXSignal" to implement posix signal handling

* Thread
    * the stupid simple sub process that works on a well defined task
    * implements posix signal handling

* AbstractTask
    * implements the unique logic a sub process should execute
    * implements
        * getProcessId()
        * getParentProcessId()
        * getRuntime()
        * getMemoryUsage()
    * provides method "setUpPOSIXSignalHandling" and "dispatchPOSIXSignal" to implement posix signal handling

## Additional Ideas

* an event listener can be used to easy up extending this component
* add shared memory for intern process calls ([ipc](https://github.com/pbergman/processes-fork/tree/master/src/PBergman/SystemV/IPC) / [fifo](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/spork/blob/master/src/Spork/Fifo.php), [shm](https://github.com/johan-adriaans/PHP-Semaphore-Fork-test/blob/master/index.php))
* add logging (by event event handler?)
* AbstractTask should implement
    * getGroupId()
    * getUserId()
    * setGroupId($groupId)
    * setUserId($userId)
    * task identifier

# Open Questions

* how to write unit tests for forking itself?
    * [option one](http://kpayne.me/2012/01/17/how-to-unit-test-fork/)
* there is a theoretical race condition problem and i have no idea how to solve this in php
    * the parent process (fork manager) has process id 123
    * a child process (task) gets process id 124
    * child gets the signal kill or finished its execution and the process id 124 is available again
    * between the usleep of the parent, a new system process gets spawned with the process id 124
    * how distinguish if the process with id 124 is the child or a new process?
