Signal Component for PHP
========================

Write a component that is oriented on shell signals and combines the ideas of the component [instruction signal](https://github.com/stevleibelt/php_component_instruction_signal), [shutdown](https://github.com/stevleibelt/php_component_shutdown) and [lock](https://github.com/stevleibelt/php_component_lock) into one component.
Furthermore, the implementation "File", "Realtime" or "Database" should be implemented as handlers since the concept itself is simple (for example putting a suffixed file into a given path).
