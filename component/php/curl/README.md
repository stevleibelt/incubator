# Simple Curl Wrapper Component for PHP

This is not a component developed to replace [guzzle]().

The main approach of this component is to create a free as in freedom basic curl object oriented component.

# Example

```php
//it is always good to ship the component with a factory to easy up usage
$factory    = new Net\Bazzline\Component\Curl\RequestFactory();
$request    = $factory->create();

$url        = 'http://www.foo.bar';

//begin of fluent interface draft
$request->requestAsPost()
    ->onTheUrl($url)
    ->withTheData($data)
    ->withTheHeaderLine($headLine)
    ->withTheOption($option)
    ->withResponseModifier($modifier)
    ->andFetchTheResponse();
//end of fluent interface draft

$response = $request->get($url);

echo $response->content();
echo $response->contentType();
echo $response->errorCode();
echo $response->statusCode();
```
