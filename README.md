# Incubator

Ideas for software projects.

Instead of creating a repository for each idea, this is the place where all the snippets and thoughts are going placed.

This time, it is a GPL-V3. If you love to start a project based on my thoughts, feel free to do it but contact me and ask me if i want to join you :-).
