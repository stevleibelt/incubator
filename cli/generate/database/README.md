# Database Generator

Inspired by a [blog entry](http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/226-4-Reasons-Why-All-PHP-Frameworks-Suck.html) and the authors [metastorage](http://www.meta-language.net/metastorage.html).  

Instead of creating runtime orm mappers that generates sql queries in runtime, it could be an solution to generate to the queries before going live.
The generator also creates Objects (like [propel](http://propelorm.org) does). The methods to add some live to this objects are the generated sql queries.

While writing, i would describe the idea like "propel on speed".
