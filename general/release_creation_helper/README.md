# Release Creation Helper

This package provides console commands to easy up creation of a release from a git repository.

# Assumption

This code is based on some assumptions.
First of all, you are working with git as version control system.
Furthermore, you are having a lot of branches. Maybe you are using git flow, or simple create a branch per defect/story (to talk in scrum terms).
Also it is assumed that each branch has a unique identifier like a ticket or a task number.

# Usage

## Find All The Branches You Want To Merge

```
#assuming you want to find the branches with unique identifiers:
#   S-1234 S-0815 S-23 S-42
./bin/net_bazzline_find_origin_branch_name S-1234 S-0815 S-2300 S-4200
#expected result
origin/story-S1234-implement_fancy_new_feature origin/story-S-0815-added_new_default_campaign origin/story-S-2300-illuminate_the_planet origin/story-S-4200-the_answere_to_all_questions
```

## Create Release Branch And Merge Branches Into It

```
#assuming you want to:
#   * create new release from branch develop
#   * new release branch should get the name 'release-0.8.15'
*   * you want to merge origin/story-S1234-implement_fancy_new_feature origin/story-S-0815-added_new_default_campaign
#   * you are currently on branch 'defect-fix_broken_unit_tests'
./bin/net_bazzline_create_release_branch develop release-0.8.15 origin/story-S1234-implement_fancy_new_feature origin/story-S-0815-added_new_default_campaign
#expected result
release "release-0.8.18" created with following branches merged:
    origin/story-S1234-implement_fancy_new_feature
    origin/story-S-0815-added_new_default_campaign
```

## Continue Merging Branches Into Release Branch

# Hints

## net_bazzline_create_release_branch

If a merge results in a conflict, use "net_bazzline_create_release_branch [...] --continue" to continue merging.
The argument "<branch to create release from>" is not used.
