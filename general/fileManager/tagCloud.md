# idea

The idea is to extend a file manager with a tag cloud.
Known from bLogs or news pages, this tag cloud would contain words and number of entries in braces.
The tag cloud should show provide following settings "recursive", "filterByDirectory", "filterByFile".
Ordering should be by number of entries and alphabetically (both descending).

# example

## example name listing of a directory

bank_name_one (directory)
bank_name_two (directory)
hamburg_links_eating.md
bangkok_links_eating.md

# example tag clouds

--directory
bank (2)
name (2)
one (1)
two (1)

--file
eating (2)
links (2)
bangkok (1)
hamburg (1)
