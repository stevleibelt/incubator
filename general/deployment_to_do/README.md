# Generic Deployment To Do System

Free as in freedom and generic approach to cover handling of deployment to does in a generic way.

# Thoughts

* based a vcs
    * support for multiple branches
    * based on recording and logging "latest commit id"
* independent from the environment (development, testing, staging or production system)
* each deployment to do list entry can be "automatically executed" or "outputed because of manual work (difficult to write a script for/external systems needed"

# Workflow

* investigate current system status
    * read deployment to do list
    * read current branch name
    * read latest vcs commit id
    * read fitting (branch dependend) log
* compare deployment to does with steps in the local log
* output or execute deployment to do list entry
* commit each finished entry into the log
* save current git branch and latest commit
* remove local (branch dependend) log if branch is deleted via git ([post branch delete hook](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14271989/git-branch-delete-hook#14285583)?)
